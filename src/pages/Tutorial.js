          is a paper-and-pencil game for two players who take turns marking the
          spaces in a three-by-three grid with X or O. The player who succeeds
          in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal
          row is the winner. It is a solved game, with a forced draw assuming
          best play from both players.
